## 기계학습 프로젝트

This project was conducted from March 2022 to June 2022 on the development of an automatic recommendation algorithm for destination based on the starting point using data on the use of call taxis for people with disabilities.

## Workflow

We created an algorithm written in Python that utilizes boosting, bagging, and other regression analysis techniques that can predict the destination.

## TODO

We have proceeded with the deployment process through the Flutter framework based on web apps, but as for the current final state, it runs normally only on the local emulator. We are currently discussing expanding the service through hosting servers in the future within our team.
